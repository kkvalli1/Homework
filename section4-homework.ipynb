    "##### 1. What does one need to do to use a module?\n",
    "Use pip to install the module \n",
    "pip install <Module>\n",
    "Import the module:\n",
    "##### 2. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.\n",
    "## Use the math module to calculate the square root of a number:\n",
    "import math\n",
    "result = math.sqrt(16)\n",
    "print(result)  \n",
    "##### 3. What is a benefit of using Exception handling?\n",
    "##### Exception handling allows to manage errors racefully without crashing the program, providing a better user experience \n",
    "##### 4.what are the 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?\n",
    "###### The four components are: try, except, else, and finally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.NumPy arrays are like what Python data type?\n",
    "##### NumPy arrays are like Python lists  with capabilities for numerical operations and multi-dimensional data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.\n",
    "##### One of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays is their ability to perform efficient numerical computations and operations on large datasets due to  optimized performance and memory usage compared to standard Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "##### One of the main requirements is that all elements in a NumPy array must be of the same data type  which allows for efficient storage and computation.\n",
    "##### 8.. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.   \n",
    "##### Numerical computations: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions to perform operations on arrays efficiently.\n",
    "##### 2. Data manipulation: NumPy allows for easy reshaping, slicing, and indexing of arrays, making it convenient to manipulate large datasets.\n",
    "##### 9.. Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?\n",
    "##### One of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy is Pandas, which is used for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 10. What is the shape of NumPy arrays? \n",
    "##### The shape of a NumPy array refers to its dimensions, represented as a tuple indicating the size of the array along each axis (e.g., (rows, columns) for a 2D array). \n",
    "##### 11. What is a Tensor?\n",
    "##### A tensor is a multi-dimensional array that generalizes the concept of scalars (0D), vectors (1D), and matrices (2D) to higher dimensions. Tensors are used in various fields, including machine learning and physics, to represent complex data structures.  \n",
    "##### 12. Name a reason why it's better using  NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?\n",
    "##### NumPy is better for data analysis than Python lists because it provides optimized performance for numerical computations, allowing for faster processing of large datasets due to its efficient memory usage and vectorized operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 13. When creating an \"empty\" array, where do the elements come from?\n",
    "##### When creating an \"empty\" array in NumPy, the elements come from whatever values are already present in the allocated memory space. This means that the array may contain arbitrary values (garbage values) until they are explicitly set or initialized.\n"
